*Demo video of the interactive 3D portfolio experience.*

This project is a 3D interactive portfolio built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). It features myself and my pet dog (ah Mao) as animated models. It consists of interactive objects in a virtual environment to showcase my projects and skills.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
